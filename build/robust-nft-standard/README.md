| üî• Burn                         | NFT can be discarded                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :bell: Events                   | Events emit a view function for others to understand changes that have happened regarding a NFT without constantly spending resources indexing a NFT checking for changes. This combined with flags can optimize an NFT indexer significantly by understand the nature of a NFT and optimizing for the type of behaviors that can be emitted.  |
| ‚øµ Metadata                      | Metadata describes the accompanying information about a NFT usually pinned on a decentralized storage solution like Arweave or IPFS                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ‚õ≥Ô∏è Flags                        | Flags are attributes that represent  values that allow indexers to understand the behavior of an NFT before spending extra bandwidth actually looking inside of a NFT's metadata. Examples of flags include, Rich Media, Dynamic, Non Transferability, Storage, Open/Closed                                                                    |
| _üß©  Composability_             | NFTs defined as "pieces" that can be rendered into a bigger "whole" set metadata render type. For more on composability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
