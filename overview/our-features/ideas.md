# üí° Ideas

While we made our standard as robust as possible there is a thin line between enabling the ecosystem to flourish and overengineering before actual business use cases emerge, users provide feedback.

There are many potentials for the future of Fuel NFTs that we left out.

## :pray: What We Want to See in the ‚ö°Ô∏èFuel Ecosystem

We can only build so much, if you are interested in implementing the following ideas, start building today.

* DAO Tooling
* Social Auth Onboarding
* NFT Swap Marketplace (Bartering)
* NFT Lending
* Quadratic Funding (GItcoin Equivalent)
* Reputation Systems (can be built on top of us)
* NFT Based DAO Tooling
  * DAO Membership that syncs to NFT Ownership
  * Permissioning based on different roles and traits within a NFT

## What We Want to Implement

### Gasless Transactions

Ability to pay for gas on behalf of users.

* Should this be included inside of a NFT?&#x20;

## What We Left Out

### :coin: NFT Fractionalization

NFT Fractionalizations tends to describe....

We believe this is more suitable for the intersection of DeFi and NFTs, and the Fuel Dev Rel team already started an reference example for this.&#x20;



## üçÑ Semifungiblity

Semifungiblity is also a concept that is in other NFT ecosystems like Etheruem adn Solana.  Sometimes referred to a SFTs

An example of this in Solana is the rare wojacks collections.&#x20;

In Ethereum there are a couple of different interpretations to Semifungiblity.

This is different than the ERC-1155 standard that originally pioneered the Semi-fungible term
