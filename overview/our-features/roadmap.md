## 🔮 Future Roadmap

While the Fuel ecosystem is still under development, no hard date for mainnet, no clear foresight on other projects in the NFT ecosystem that will get funded, and no desire  to outline anything that isn't a milestone with clear & necessary acceptance criteria / deliverables, it's ill advised to promise anything outside the aforesaidmentioned scope....which is alot of glass chewing. But we do have ideas and things we want to implement in the future

### 👀 What We Want to Implement

Some things just didnt make the cut.&#x20;

**Gasless Transactions:** Ability to pay for gas on behalf of users

**Minting Traits**: as opposed to create composable NFTs from individual pieces, we "break" off a piece by minting off a metadata attribute of existing NFT.



For more general ideas that we left out and we want to be implemented in the NEAR Ecosystem.
