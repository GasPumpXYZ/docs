# üìò Glossary

* **Composability** feature allows you to experiment with bundling together different assets to create bespoke NFT packages
* **NFT metadata** is a set of data that makes up the content of an NFT, and is usually specified in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. The metadata of an NFT can describe its characteristics and properties, such as its name, description, transaction history, traits, link to the hosted image, and more.
* **Soul Bound**: or SBTs are non-transferable NFTs once you acquire one, it will always be tied to your personal wallet and identity, and cannot be sold or given to another person
* **Collection Minting**: A collection is considered a ‚Äúgroup‚Äù of NFTs that are associated with each other traditionally by a smart contract. In this case we are referring to the associated of NFTs to each other indexable directly on the blockchain. However, due to allowing for the robustness of an NFT, cardinality, and association may change as the ‚ÄúFuel‚Äù definition of a collection
* **Minting** refers to publishing a unique digital asset on a blockchain so that it can be bought, sold, and traded.
* A **software** development kit (SDK)t is a collection of software development tools in one installable package.
* A **crate** is a compilation unit in Rust. Whenever rustc some\_file.rs is called, some\_file.rs is treated as the crate file.
* **Sway** is a domain-specific language (DSL) for the Fuel Virtual Machine (FuelVM), a blockchain-optimized VM designed for the Fuel blockchain. Sway is based on Rust, and includes syntax to leverage a blockchain VM without needlessly verbose boilerplate.[https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/latest/](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/latest/)
* **Flag** is an identified that indicates categorization of a NFT to easily query NFT types without looking directly inside NFT metadata to prevent marketplaces, wallets, and explorers from building their indexers or saving indexer costs.
* A **testnet** denotes an instance of a blockchain powered by the same or a newer version of the underlying software, to be used for testing and experimentation without risk to real funds or the main chain
* Fuel Testnet denotes.
  * As of the writing of this proposal Fuel is currently on ‚Ä¶
* **Fuel Network** is a modular execution layer, currently on beta net.
* **Event**:&#x20;
